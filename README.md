# **E-Ramen website**

This is a project made for my study in BINUS University, specifically in Human and Computer Interaction class.
The website is made with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following the restrictions given by the lecturer.

What I've learnt from this project:
1. Creating a custom 'media player' type of carousel can be done using the same approach as a regular carousel.
2. Filtering products (if the data is not huge) can be done easily with array filtering. This can also be done on data from databases, when storing data is manageable in the program rather than calling API multiple times only for filtering.
3. Adding Google Maps can be done easily using HTML's iframe.
